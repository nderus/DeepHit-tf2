# DeepHit (Unofficial PyTorch Implementation)

DeepHit is a neural network-based model for survival analysis that can handle competing risks. This repository contains an **unofficial refactor** of the original DeepHit model, implemented in PyTorch.

## Introduction

This repository provides an implementation of the DeepHit model using PyTorch. It supports survival analysis with competing risks, and is based on the official implementation available [here](https://github.com/chl8856/DeepHit).

## Disclaimer

This is an **unofficial** implementation of DeepHit in PyTorch. If you are looking for the official version, it is available [here](https://github.com/chl8856/DeepHit).

The purpose of this repository is to bring DeepHit to the PyTorch ecosystem for research and experimentation. While efforts have been made to keep this implementation faithful to the original, there might be slight differences due to the refactor.
